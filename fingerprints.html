					<div class="entry">
					  <p>You may not thought of much when you touched a doorknob or a glass window, but you may have left something behind: your fingerprint. Formed by ridges and valleys, fingerprints are unique to each individual and remain unchanged throughout an individual's lifetime, making it a reliable method of identification in forensic science. The study of fingerprint analysis involves the examination, classification, and comparison of these patterns to determine if they match with the prints found at a crime scene. This technique has been used for over a century and continues to be a crucial tool in criminal investigations today.</p>

					<div class="entry">
					  <p>Fingerprints are collected using a variety of methods, but the most common method involves the use of fingerprint ink pads and cards. The person being fingerprinted is typically asked to roll their fingertips, one at a time, onto an ink pad, which contains a special ink that is designed to make a clear, high-contrast impression of the fingerprint. The inked finger is then rolled onto a special card that has a clean, smooth surface. This process is repeated for all ten fingers, and sometimes for the thumbs as well. Other methods of collecting fingerprints include digital scanning or imaging, which involves using specialized equipment to capture high-resolution images of the fingerprints, and chemical methods, which involve using a chemical agent to reveal latent fingerprints on a surface.</p>
