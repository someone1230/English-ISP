					<div class="entry">
					  <p>DNA evidence is a powerful tool in forensic science that can be used to link a suspect to a crime scene or exonerate someone who has been wrongly accused. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions for the development and function of all living organisms. Every person's DNA is unique, except in the case of identical twins.</p>

				  <div class="entry">
					  <p>In forensic science, DNA evidence is typically collected from blood, semen, saliva, or other bodily fluids left at a crime scene or on a piece of evidence. The DNA is extracted from the sample and analyzed in a laboratory using various techniques, including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis.</p>
					  <p>PCR is used to amplify, or copy, small amounts of DNA so that it can be analyzed. STR analysis is a technique that examines certain regions of DNA that vary between individuals, allowing for the comparison of DNA profiles between a suspect and a sample from a crime scene.</p>

				  <h2 class="title">Comparison</h2>
				  <div class="entry">
					  <p>Once the DNA has been analyzed, the results can be compared to a database of known DNA profiles to determine whether the sample matches that of a suspect or a victim. The most likely suspects are those close to the victim, those close to the crime scene, or convicted criminals. DNA evidence can also be used to exclude a suspect from a crime scene or to link multiple crimes together based on a matching DNA profile.</p>
					  <p>It is important to note that DNA evidence alone cannot prove guilt or innocence, but it can provide strong evidence that can be used in conjunction with other evidence in a criminal trial. DNA evidence is also subject to strict protocols and quality control measures to ensure its accuracy and reliability.</p>
