					<div class="entry">
						<p>Ever thought about the most basic actions being used against you? Everything you do, there would always be something left behind. This is the basis for the field of forensic science, using whatever that is left behind to solve crime. Whether it be camera footage to a fingerprint left on a doorknob, there could be many ways to prove a person guilty.</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>Take a close look at your finger. You may see a pattern of ridges that wrap around each other. Fingerprints are one of the oldest methods of identification, possibly dating back to the ancient times.</p>

						<p>Cytosine, Guanine, Adenine, and Thymine. The four nucleobases that make up DNA can form an endless amount of seqences that is distinct in each individual. Many uses can come from using DNA as evidence. Before DNA really took off, investigators simply compared the hair sample of the suspect to that of what was on the crime scene, which didn't prove to be very reliable. Now, simply comparing the DNA of the suspect to that from the crime scene would allow for the judge to reach a conviction.</p>
